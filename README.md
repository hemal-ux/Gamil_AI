   - On Windows, try running Command Prompt as Administrator

2. **Installation Issues**
   - Delete the `.venv` directory and try again
   - Make sure you have write permissions in the directory
   - Check your internet connection

3. **Windows-Specific Issues**
   - If you see `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pyaudioop'`, follow these steps:
     1. Install Visual C++ Redistributable from [Microsoft's website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist)
     2. Try running Command Prompt as Administrator
     3. If the error persists, follow these manual installation steps:
        ```
        Step 1: Download PyAudio wheel file
        - Go to: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio
        - Find the correct version for your Python:
          - For Python 3.8: Download "PyAudioâ€‘0.2.11â€‘cp38â€‘cp38â€‘win_amd64.whl"
          - For Python 3.9: Download "PyAudioâ€‘0.2.11â€‘cp39â€‘cp39â€‘win_amd64.whl"
          - For Python 3.10: Download "PyAudioâ€‘0.2.11â€‘cp310â€‘cp310â€‘win_amd64.whl"
          - For Python 3.11: Download "PyAudioâ€‘0.2.11â€‘cp311â€‘cp311â€‘win_amd64.whl"
        
        Step 2: Install the wheel file
        - Open Command Prompt as Administrator
        - Navigate to where you downloaded the wheel file
        - Run this command (replace [filename] with the actual filename you downloaded):
          .venv\Scripts\pip.exe install [filename]
        
        Example:
        If you downloaded PyAudioâ€‘0.2.11â€‘cp310â€‘cp310â€‘win_amd64.whl to your Downloads folder:
        .venv\Scripts\pip.exe install C:\Users\YourUsername\Downloads\PyAudioâ€‘0.2.11â€‘cp310â€‘cp310â€‘win_amd64.whl
        ```
   - If you see other audio-related errors:
     1. Make sure your system's audio drivers are up to date
